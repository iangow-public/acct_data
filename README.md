Data for accounting research
=========

This repository contains code to pull together data from various sources including:
- WRDS
- SEC EDGAR
- Ken French's website
- [Whalewisdom](whalewisdom/README.md)

Note that some of these data sets are proprietary, so the code will only work if you have access to the data in some form.
