This repository contains used to contain code to pull together data from various sources including:
- [SEC EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm). Now see [this repository](https://github.com/mccgr/edgar).
- Ken French's [website](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). Now see [this repository](https://github.com/iangow/ff).
- [Whalewisdom](whalewisdom/README.md). Now in [this (private) repository](https://github.com/iangow/whalewisdom).
- Code related to [WRDS](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/) was moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/mccgr/wrds_pg) on 27 September 2015.

Note that some of the data sets I use are proprietary, so the code will only work if you have access to the data in some form.
